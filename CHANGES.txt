[0.5.0] - 3/15/2011

  * Change log started.

  * MailerBase.Email() method now has only one overload with two optional parameters
      for model and masterName.  ViewName is now required because of the bug identified
      in Issue #7 on BitBucket.  This is a breaking change.  All you need to do is
      modify your existing EmailResult actions to pass a viewName to the Email() method.

  * Areas should now be detected properly.  Thanks to Miroslav Popovic for submitting
      some sample code to fix this in Issue #11.  Also thanks to Jeremy Kuhlman for
      bringing this issue to my attention as well.
