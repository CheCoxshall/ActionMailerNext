[0.6.1] - 8/16/2011
  * Multipart messages will now render the plain text view first and the HTML view
      last.  This fixes Issue #23 and should cause multipart messages to render
      correctly in standards-compliant email clients (i.e. Thunderbird).

[0.6.0] - 7/5/2011

  * Started support for standalone Razor-based email generation.  This means you can
      now generate emails with the Razor syntax without any need for ASP.NET MVC 3.

  * Moved EmailResult, MailerBase and all UrlHelper and HtmlHelper extensions into the
      ActionMailer.Net.Mvc assembly.  This is because of the new standalone Razor
      support that has been introduced.  All this really means is that you need to
      change your current using/imports statements to ActionMailer.Net.Mvc.

  * Re-organized unit tests to account for the separation between MVC and standalone.

  * Breaking Change:  MailerBase is now an abstract class with a protected constructor.
      This basically ensures that MailerBase can only be inherited (not instantiated).
      This should have been the case all along, but I just forgot to make it happen.

[0.5.0] - 3/15/2011

  * Change log started.

  * MailerBase.Email() method now has only one overload with two optional parameters
      for model and masterName.  ViewName is now required because of the bug identified
      in Issue #7 on BitBucket.  This is a breaking change.  All you need to do is
      modify your existing EmailResult actions to pass a viewName to the Email() method.

  * Areas should now be detected properly.  Thanks to Miroslav Popovic for submitting
      some sample code to fix this in Issue #11.  Also thanks to Jeremy Kuhlman for
      bringing this issue to my attention as well.
