[0.6.0] - TBD

  * Started support for standalone Razor-based email generation.  This means you can
      now generate emails with the Razor syntax without any need for ASP.NET MVC 3.

  * Re-namespaced EmailResult, MailerBase and all UrlHelper and HtmlHelper extensions
      into the ActionMailer.Net.Mvc namespace.  This is because of the new standalone
      Razor support that has been introduced.  All this really means is that you need
      to change your using/imports statements to ActionMailer.Net.Mvc.

  * Re-organized unit tests to account for the separation between MVC and standalone.

[0.5.0] - 3/15/2011

  * Change log started.

  * MailerBase.Email() method now has only one overload with two optional parameters
      for model and masterName.  ViewName is now required because of the bug identified
      in Issue #7 on BitBucket.  This is a breaking change.  All you need to do is
      modify your existing EmailResult actions to pass a viewName to the Email() method.

  * Areas should now be detected properly.  Thanks to Miroslav Popovic for submitting
      some sample code to fix this in Issue #11.  Also thanks to Jeremy Kuhlman for
      bringing this issue to my attention as well.
